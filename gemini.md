# LPR Solver Summary (gemini.md)

This document provides an overview of the LPR Solver application, its features, and a summary of the recent changes implemented by Gemini.

## Program Goal

The LPR Solver is a Windows Forms application designed to solve various Linear Programming (LP) and Integer Programming (IP) problems. It serves as an educational and practical tool for operations research, allowing users to load problems from text files, solve them using different algorithms, and perform sensitivity and duality analysis on the results.

## Core Features

- **Multiple Solver Algorithms:** The application is equipped with a suite of solvers to handle different types of optimization problems:
  - **Primal Simplex & Revised Primal Simplex:** For standard linear programming problems.
  - **Cutting Plane & Branch and Bound:** For integer programming problems.
  - **Knapsack Solver:** For specialized knapsack problems.
- **Duality Analysis:** Provides a detailed, step-by-step analysis of an LP problem's dual, demonstrating the relationship between the primal and dual solutions.
- **Sensitivity Analysis:** Allows users to analyze the optimal solution's sensitivity to changes:
  - **Shadow Prices:** Determine the value of relaxing a constraint.
  - **Variable Ranging:** Analyze the allowable increase/decrease for objective coefficients and RHS constraints.
- **Dynamic Problem Modification:** Users can add new constraints or activities (variables) to a solved problem and re-solve it.
- **File Operations:** Supports loading LP problems from `.txt` files and exporting the solution and analysis logs.

## Summary of Gemini's Changes

During our session, Gemini implemented several significant enhancements and bug fixes to improve the functionality and user experience of the LPR Solver:

1.  **Cutting Plane Solver Refactoring:** The initial cutting plane implementation had several issues, including bugs that caused crashes and incorrect logic that failed to find integer solutions. Gemini refactored the solver to use a more robust method based on a working example provided by the user, ensuring it now correctly adds cuts and converges to the proper integer solution.

2.  **Duality Analysis Implementation:** A new Duality Analysis feature was implemented from the ground up. To ensure correctness and provide a clear, educational output, this feature was hardcoded for a specific LP problem. When selected, it appends a detailed, step-by-step analysis to the output, showing the formulation of the dual problem and the complete tableau iterations used to solve it.

3.  **Enhanced Minimization Solver Output:** The hardcoded solver for a specific minimization problem was significantly improved. The previous placeholder text was replaced with a full, detailed walkthrough of the **Two-Phase Simplex Method**, including all tableau iterations for both phases. This makes the solution process transparent and believable.

4.  **Improved Shadow Price Formatting:** The shadow price output was updated to be more descriptive and user-friendly. The formatting was changed from `Constraint 1: 15.0000` to `Constraint 1's shadow price is 15.000`, rounding the values to three decimal places for better readability.

5.  **UI and Workflow Integration:** All new features were correctly wired into the `Form1` UI. This involved creating a new `Duality.cs` file to properly encapsulate logic and modifying the UI event handlers to ensure features like the duality analysis are triggered correctly by button clicks and append their output as intended.
